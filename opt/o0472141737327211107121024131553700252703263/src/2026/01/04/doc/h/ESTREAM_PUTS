The estream_puts Function "estream_puts.h"

            The estream_puts function takes no action if #0
            is a null pointer. Otherwise, the estream_puts
            function indirectly writes to the standard error
            stream the initial non-null characters of the
            string pointed to by #0.
              Characters are sent to the standard error
            stream via repeated calls to the estream_putc
            function, and characters sent to the standard
            error stream will be in accordance with the
            estream_putc function.
              The number of characters written is limited to
            the lesser of the minimum value of INT_MAX and
            the product of ESTREAM_HEIGHT and ESTREAM_WIDTH.
              If #0 is a null pointer, the estream_puts
            function behaves as if #0 pointed to a null
            string.
              The caller must guarantee that #0 indicates an
            object terminated by a null character.
              The estream_puts function is intended to be
            called with arguments computed from string
            literals found in the source.
