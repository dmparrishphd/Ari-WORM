The istream_skip Function "istream_skip.h"

            The istream_skip function attempts to read
            characters from the standard input stream until
            a new-line character is encountered. The
            characters read are not stored.
              If a file error occurs the istream_skip
            function returns a positive value,
            indicating failure.
              Otherwise, if a new-line character is not
            encountered after reading #0 characters, the
            istream_skip function returns a positive value,
            indicating failure.
              Otherwise, if an end-of-file condition is
            detected before a new-line character is read,
            the istream_skip function returns a negative
            value, indicating atypical behavior.
              Otherwise, a new-line character has been
            encountered within #0 characters and the
            istream_skip function returns zero, indicating
            success.
