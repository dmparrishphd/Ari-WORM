The istream_read Function "istream_read.h"

            The istream_read function is intended to support
            the istream_refetch function.
              The istream_read function attempts to read the
            next line from stdin into the array indicated by
            #0 using istream_skim.
              If istream_skim produces an error, an error
            message is sent to stderr and a positive value
            is returned, indicating failure.
              Otherwise, if the input was rejected, a
            warning message is sent to stderr and a negative
            value is returned, indicating atypical behavior.
              Otherwise, if the characters of the data read
            are all in character set P, the istream_read
            function returns zero, indicating success and
            the string which starts in the first character
            array constitutes the data read.
              Otherwise, the characters of the data read are
            not all in character set P. The array is
            cleared, a warning message is sent to sdterr and
            the istream_read function returns a negative
            value, indicating atypical behavior.
