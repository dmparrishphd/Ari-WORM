The estream_prompt Function "estream_prompt.h"

            The estream_prompt function writes to the
            standard error stream, on its own line, a
            sequence of characters intended to prompt the
            user to supply input.
              The intention is that the prompt also indicate
            the maximum number of characters---from
            character set P---that may be accepted from a
            single line of input.
