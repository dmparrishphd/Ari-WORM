Tracing "tracer.h"

            The tracer.h header declares a type and defines
            macros that are intended to facilitate the
            tracing of control flow, particularly in cases
            where errors or atypical behavior occur.

    Types

        struct s_tracer and
        tracer

            The typedef name tracer is an alias of the type
            struct s_tracer.
              It is intended that objects of type tracer be
            used to facilitate the reporting of certain
            aspects of control flow.
              When used as intended, an object of type
            tracer provides access to the current
            function, file, and line number.

    Macros

            The macros TRACER_DECLARE and TRACER are
            intended to be used together.

            The TRACER_DECLARE macro expands to declare an
            object of type tracer that is initialized to
            specify the current function name and file name.
            Upon initialization, the line number specified
            by the object is not significant.

            The TRACER macro expands to have the effect that
            the line number specified by the object
            previously declared by TRACER_DECLARE is updated
            before providing a pointer to the object.
