The estream_put_msg Function "estream_put_msg.h"

            The estream_put_msg function is intended to be
            called by
                -   estream_put_note,
                -   estream_put_warning, or
                -   estream_put_error.
            The estream_put_msg writes indirectly to the
            standard error stream, on its own logical line,
            a message.  When called as intended, the message
            indicates: the type of message (#0); the file
            name containing the source for the call, the
            line number of that file, the function from
            which the call was made (#1); and a description
            of program state, progress, etc. (#2).
              The type of message is specified by #0: a note
            if #0 is zero, a warning if #0 is less than
            zero, and an error if #0 is greater than zero.
