    The charsets_reset function

            Two character sets, G and P, are defined with a
            call to the charsets_reset function. The
            charsets_reset function should be called just
            after program startup, during program
            initialization.

            Character set G contains only the graphic
            characters of the basic character set (N2176
            5.2.1-1):

                ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
                abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
                0123456789
                !"#%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?[\]^_{|}~

            The characters

                -   U+0024 (DOLLAR SIGN),
                -   U+0040 (COMMERCIAL AT), and
                -   U+0060 (GRAVE ACCENT)

            are not in character set G.
              Character set P contains only the printing
            characters of the basic character set (N2176
            5.2.1-1).
              Character set P contains exactly one more
            element than character set G: the space
            character.
              Each character in character set P is assigned
            a unique index in the range 0 to UCHAR_MAX
            inclusive. Likewise for character set G.

    The chrg function

              Each index in the range 0 to UCHAR_MAX
            inclusive is assigned a character from character
            set G; this mapping may be examined by calls to
            the chrg function. 

    The chrp function

              Each index in the range 0 to UCHAR_MAX
            inclusive is assigned a character from character
            set P; this mapping may be examined by calls to
            the chrp function. 

            The mappings represented by the chrg and chrp
            functions are identical except for the case
            where the index maps to a space in character set P.

    Graphical Space

            A graphical character standing for a space
            character should be returned by the call
            { chrg ( space ) }. Such a "graphic space" is
            intended to be substituted for a space character
            when a space character is submitted but a
            character in G is required. It is intended that
            in the sequence of characters written to the
            standard error stream, non-graphic characters
            not immediately precede new-line characters.
            The graphic space is intended to facilitate
            enforcing such a scheme. 

    Substitute Character

            A graphical character standing for a nonprinting
            character should be returned by the call
            { chrg ( newline ) }. Such a "substitute
            character" is intended to be substituted when
            character not in P is submitted but a character
            in P is required. It is intended that all
            characters written to the standard error stream
            produce a visible representation. The substitute
            character is intended to facilitate enforcing
            such a scheme.
