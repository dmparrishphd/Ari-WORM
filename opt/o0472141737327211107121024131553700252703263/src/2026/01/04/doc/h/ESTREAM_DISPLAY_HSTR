The estream_display_hstr Function "estream_display_hstr.h"

            The estream_display_hstr function writes to
            the standard error stream, on its own line, the
            short string indicated by #0.
              Before writing the characters of the string,
            the active position is advanced to the next line
            if it is not already at the beginning of a line.
            Similarly, after writing the string, the active
            position is advanced to the beginning of the
            following line if it is not already at the
            beginning of a line.
