The is_hstr_blank Function "is_hstr_blank.h"

            The is_hstr_blank function behaves as if: 1) the
            initial HSTR_SIZE_MAX characters of the array
            specified by #0 were first copied to a
            temporary, non-overlapping array of
            HSTR_SIZE_MAX characters, and 2) the final
            character of the temporary array is reassigned
            to be a null character. Let s be the string
            whose initial character is the initial character
            of the temporary array.
              The is_hstr_blank function returns true if s
            is a null string or every character of
            s---except the TNC---is a space character.
