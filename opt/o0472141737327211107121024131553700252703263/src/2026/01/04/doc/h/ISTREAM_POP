The istream_pop Function "istream_pop.h"

            By design, the istream_pop function should be
            the only means by which characters are attempted
            to be read from stdin.
              The istream_pop function attempts to read a
            character from stdin. If and only if character
            is read successfully, it is copied into the
            object specified by #0.
              The istream_pop function returns zero on
            success.  Otherwise, if an error occurred, The
            istream_pop function returns a positive value.
            Otherwise, atypical behavior occurred and the
            istream_pop function returns a negative value.
            Atypical behavior includes an end-of-file
            condition in stdin as well as the occurrence of
            an interactive attention signal.
