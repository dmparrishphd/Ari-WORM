        HSTR_SIZE_MAX

            A short string is a string having no more than
            HSTR_SIZE_MAX characters (including the TNC). A
            short string of printing characters may be
            displayed on a single line of the display
            connected to the standard error stream.
              Short strings are typically stored in an array
            of type { char [ HSTR_SIZE_MAX ] }.
              See also functions named with the prefix
            or infix "hstr."

        HSTR_INDEX_MAX

            Processes operating on short strings should not
            attempt to access characters of short strings
            beyond the character with index HSTR_INDEX_MAX.
              In a proper short string, the character with
            index HSTR_INDEX_MAX should be a null character.

        HSTR_LEN_MAX

            If p points to the initial character of a short
            string, strlen ( p ) should not return a value
            greater than HSTR_LEN_MAX.
