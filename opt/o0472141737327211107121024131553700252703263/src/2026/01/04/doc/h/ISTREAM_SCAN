The istream_scan function "istream_scan.h"

            The istream_scan function attempts to read one
            line from stdin. The istream_scan function
            assumes that reading beings at the beginning of
            a logical line.
              If an error occurs, a positive value is
            returned.
              Otherwise, if an end-of-file condition occurs,
            a negative value is returned, indicating
            atypical behavior.
              Otherwise, if more than HSTR_LEN_MAX
            characters have been read before a new-line
            character has been read, an attempt is made to
            skip subsequent characters until a new-line
            character is read. If, when attempting to skip,
            the number of characters read (including those
            read prior to the skip-attempt) accumulates to
            ISTREAM_SKIP_LIMIT before a new-line character
            is encountered, a positive value is returned,
            indicating an error; otherwise, the line is
            skipped and a negative value is returned,
            indicating atypical behavior.
              Otherwise, a) a line has been successfully
            read into the object specified by #0, which
            stores the corresponding string---the new-line
            character is discarded---and b) zero is
            returned, indicating success.
