The istream_scrape Function "istream_scrape.h"

            The typical behavior of the istream_scrape
            function is to read the next character from
            the standard input stream.
              The istream_scrape function calls the
            istream_pop function. If the istream_pop
            function returns, the return code and the
            character read are stored.
              If istream_pop returns, the return-value is
            stored. Then, if the return-value is non-zero,
            it is returned. Otherwise, the return-value of
            the call to istream_pop is zero; the character
            read is converted to a { char } object and
            stored in the initial byte of the object
            specified by #0.
