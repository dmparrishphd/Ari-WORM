The doatexit Function "doatexit.h"

            The doatexit function is intended to allow a
            single call of the atexit function (N2176
            7.22.4.2) to specify processing that should
            occur during normal program termination.
              By design, the atexit function is called
            during program initialization.
              The doatexit function is intended to be used
            as the argument to the atexit function.
