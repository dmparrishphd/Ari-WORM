The istream_skim Function "istream_skim.h"

            The istream_skim function is intended to fetch
            into the object specified by #0 the next line of
            data from the standard input stream.
              The istream_skim function repeatedly calls the
            istream_scan function.
              If a call to istream_scan fails, the
            istream_skim function returns a positive value,
            indicating an error.
              Otherwise, if the istream_scan function
            returns a negative value (atypical behavior),
            the process repeats.
              Otherwise, if the characters read are all
            blank and fewer than ISTREAM_HEIGHT calls to
            istream_scan have been made, the process
            repeats.
              Otherwise, if one or more nonblank
            characters have been read on the initial
            HSTR_LEN_MAX characters of the line, the
            array stores the corresponding data and the
            istream_skim function returns zero, indicating
            success.
              Otherwise, ISTREAM_HEIGHT blank lines have
            been read; the istream_skim function returns a
            positive value, indicating failure.
