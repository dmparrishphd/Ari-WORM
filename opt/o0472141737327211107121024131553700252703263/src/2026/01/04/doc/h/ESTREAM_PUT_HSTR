The estream_put_hstr Function

            The estream_put_hstr function sends the non-null
            characters of the string specified by #0 to the
            standard error stream via the estream_putc
            function. 
              The estream_put_hstr function behaves as if
            the final character of the character array
            specified by #0 were a terminating null
            character.
