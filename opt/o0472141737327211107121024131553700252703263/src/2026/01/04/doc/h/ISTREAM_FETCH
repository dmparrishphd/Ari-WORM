The istream_fetch Function "istream_read.h"

            The istream_fetch function is intended to
            support the istream_refetch function.
              The istream_fetch function attempts to read
            the next line of data from stdin via the
            istream_read function.
              If the call to the istream_read function is
            successful, the corresponding data are stored in
            the array specified by #0 and The istream_fetch
            function returns 0, indicating success.
              Otherwise, if the istream_read function
            returns an error code, an error message is sent
            to stderr and istream_fetch returns a positive
            value, indicating an error.
              Otherwise, if the istream_read function
            returns a negative value, indicating atypical
            behavior, the process repeats if fewer than
            ISTREAM_HEIGHT calls to the istream_read
            function have been made; otherwise,
            ISTREAM_HEIGHT unsuccessful calls to istream_read
            have been made: an error message is sent to
            stderr and the istream_fetch function returns a
            positive value, indicating an error.
