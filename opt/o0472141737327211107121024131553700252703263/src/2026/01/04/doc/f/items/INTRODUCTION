Introduction

            The documentation is organized into several
            directories.

            the doc-f directory contains frontmatter,
            including the present file.

            The doc directory contains one documentatin file
            for each header file. That documentation
            is focused on the macros, objects, and functions
            discussed by the corresponding header.

            The doc-e directory contains endnotes. The
            topics therein may overlap with multiple header
            files.
