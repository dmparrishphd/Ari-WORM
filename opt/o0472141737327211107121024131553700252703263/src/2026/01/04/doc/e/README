Endnotes

            The endnotes cover topics that are not
            particular to a single header file, but span
            multiple header files.

            The endnotes are indexed by the file doc-e/INDEX
              There are two types of records in the INDEX.
            One record lists a Keyword, a related Topic, and
            the corresponding Item ID.  The other type of
            record lists an Item ID along with the Title of
            the Item.
            
            Items are stored in files named by Item ID under
            the items subdirectory.
