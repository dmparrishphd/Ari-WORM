Reading from Standard Input

            The istream_refetch function is intended to be
            the primary means by which data is read from
            standard input. While the functions

                -   istream_fetch,
                -   istream_read,
                -   istream_skim,
                -   istream_scan,
                -   istream_scrape,
                -   istream_skip, and
                -   istream_pop

            also read from standard input, they are designed
            to support (whether directy or indirectly) the
            istream_refetch function and are not intended to
            be called other than as components of the
            istream_refetch function.
