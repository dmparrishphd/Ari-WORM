The TRACE macro is intended to be used in the
place of the initial three arguments ("trace"
sounds like the Spanish word for three) of calls
to
    -   the estream_put_note function,
    -   the estream_put_warning function, and
    -   the estream_put_error function
so that any of those calls print
    -   the presumed source file name,
    -   the presumed line number, and
    -   the name of the function
wherein the call is found.
