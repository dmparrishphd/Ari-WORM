The estream_put_diagnostic function is intended
to be called by estream_put_msg.  It writes
indirectly to the standard error stream, on its
own logical line, a message in the form of a
colon-separated list of strings.  When called as
intended, the strings indicate: the file name
containing the source for the call (#0), the
line number of that file (#1), and the function
from which the call was made (#2).
