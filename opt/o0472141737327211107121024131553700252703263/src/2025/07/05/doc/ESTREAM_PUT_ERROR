The estream_put_error function writes indirectly
to the standard error stream, on its own logical
line, a message in the form of a colon-separated
list of strings.  When called as intended, the
strings indicate: That an error message is being
reported, the file name containing the source
for the call (#0), the line number of that file
(#1), the function from which the call was made
(#2), and some text describing program state,
progress, etc. (#3).
  The intent is that the call be made with the
TRACE macro in the place of the initial three
arguments, e.g.:
        estream_put_error (
            TRACE , "some message" )
