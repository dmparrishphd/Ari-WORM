The estream_put_msg function is intended to be
called by
    -   estream_put_note,
    -   estream_put_warning, or
    -   estream_put_error.
It writes indirectly to the standard error
stream, on its own logical line, a message in
the form of a colon-separated list of strings.
When called as intended, the strings indicate:
the type of message, the file name containing
the source for the call (#1), the line number of that
file (#2), the function from which the call was
made (#3),
and some text describing program state,
progress, etc. (#4).
  The type of message is asserted by #0: a note
if #0 is zero, a warning if #0 is less than
zero, and an error if #0 is greater than zero.
