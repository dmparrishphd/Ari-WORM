The estream_puts function indirectly writes to
the standard error stream a character for each
non-null character of the string pointed to by
#0.  Each character written is computed by using
the corresponding member of the string as the
index of the character in the charsetp character
array, and fetching the corresponding character,
except that spaces at the end of lines are
replaced by a corresponding graphic character.
  If #0 is a null pointer, the estream_puts
function behaves as if #0 pointed to a null
string.
  The caller must guarantee that #0 indicates an
object terminated by a null character.
  The estream_puts function is intended to be
called with arguments computed from string
literals found in the source.
